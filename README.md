# EEGDnet: Fusing non-local and local self-similarity for EEG signal denoising with transformer

[//]: # (**[Warning] The method suffers from the overfitting issue. We will re-evaluate our NAC-UE on the OpenOOD v1.5 and update the code and arxiv ASAP.**)

This is the official PyTorch implementation of our [EEGDnet: Fusing non-local and local self-similarity for EEG signal denoising with transformer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482522009568). If you have any problem, please drop the email to me (ck.ee@my.cityu.edu.hk).

## Usage
```
conda env create -f environment.yml;
pip install libmr==0.1.9
```
